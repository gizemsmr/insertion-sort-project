insertion sort project

a) ->insertion sort of [22,27,16,2,18,6]
1- [2,27,16,22,18,6]
   [2,6,16,22,18,27]
   [2,6,16,18,22,27]

2- O(n^2)   

3-18 is in the middle, so it is the average case.

b)four steps of insertion sort
[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]

1-[2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
2-[2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]
3-[2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
4-[2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7]
